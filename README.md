# Task-Management-System-using-swings
The Java-based Task Management System is designed to streamline communication and task assignments between employers and employees, providing a structured platform for organizing tasks, tracking progress, and managing work priorities. Using a client-server architecture, the system enables employers to create, assign, and monitor tasks and employees to view and update their task statuses. A user-friendly Java Swing interface allows seamless navigation, with the employer and employee dashboards displaying real-time updates from a centralized MySQL database. This project aims to increase workplace productivity and organization by providing a system that simplifies task management and communication, enhancing accountability and efficiency in a collaborative environment.
